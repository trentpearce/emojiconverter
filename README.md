This short R script converts emojis into their representative text, based on the Unicode 15.0 Emoji List (Sept. 13, 2022). 
I built this converter to incorporate emojis into Natural Language Processing tasks such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
Instructions are embedded within the R file and are relatively straightforward. Enjoy!
